# __Traveling-Salesman-Problem__

## __Overview__

The traveling salesman problem (TSP): given a set of cities and the distances between each,
what is the shortest path that visits each city once and returns to the starting city? The problem
is usually modeled with a weighted graph and has been studied extensively. The solution
involves making a decision about which city to visit next and as such it belongs to a large class
of combinatorial optimization problems that can be solved by searching for the optimal answer.
The time complexity of such a search is exponential and only problems of modest size can be
solved. Applications of the TSP include: vehicle routing, scheduling, integrated circuit design,
DNA sequencing and the tracking of stars. This assignment involves the implementation of a
program to experiment with some basic solutions to the TSP and to time their performance.
